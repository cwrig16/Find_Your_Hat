# Find_Your_Hat

## Description
You've lost your hat! Fortunately, this terminal game will allow you to retrieve it.  Your hat (^) is lost in a field full of holes (0) that you must navigate in order to collect your it.  By moving your marker (*) around the field, avoiding the holes and staying within the boundaries, you will once again be reunited with your favorite hat.

## Features
1. The field appears in your terminal every time you make a move.
2. Your path is tracked as you move through the field so you don't have to look in places you've already searched.
3. If you try to leave the field, the game ends.
4. If you fall in a hole before finding your hat, the game ends.
5. Find your hat and win the game!

## How to Use
1. Type "node main.js" into your command line and press enter.
2. A field will appear with your location (*), holes (0), and your hat (^) laid out within the field. 
3. Choose a direction to move your player by typing U for up, D for down, L for left or R for right (not case sensitive). 
4. If you direct your player out of the field or into a hole, you lose.
5. Avoid all holes while staying in bounds on your way to find your hat to win the game.
